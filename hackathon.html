                    <h3 class="category">Health</h3>
                    <p class="catdes">Health has always been a field where
                        issues are created just as often as they
                        are solved. While epidemics such as the infamous chicken
                        pox and measles are
                        almost fully eradicated, cancer, obesity, and other
                        degenerative diseases are
                        facing our society today. And that isn’t all — there are
                        plenty of physical and
                        mental disabilities that limit other people’s ability to
                        succeed. In Health,
                        your goal is to help make the world a safe, inclusive
                        place — with a project
                        that makes someone’s life easier, whether it’s a
                        modern-day text-to-speak
                        program or an ingenious app for quick medical
                        communication.</p>
                    <h3 class="category">Business</h3>
                    <p class="catdes">We’re in Silicon Valley, the core of
                        American entrepreneurship — and
                        ultra-competitive, at that! Students participating in
                        Expo Hacks will get to see
                        a combination of tech and business that will coalesce to
                        show them what exactly
                        the Tri-Valley is about; the versatile application of
                        online skills to problems
                        that aren’t only faced by ordinary people, but startups
                        and corporations as
                        well. Let your passion for tech take you above and
                        beyond — accept no limits!</p>
                    <h3 class="category">Education</h3>
                    <p class="catdes">School is a staple in most people’s lives
                        for more than a decade — and education
                        is an area in tech that can often go overlooked. What do
                        you think is a problem
                        your school needs to solve? What issue do you know you
                        can fix? Use your skills
                        to create multi-faceted, inventive, accessible
                        solutions. And remember, use your
                        imagination — education can encompass an enterprising
                        way to raise female
                        education rates in developing countries or address
                        poverty in systems all around
                        the world. It’s all about knowledge; use yours to help
                        educate the world!</p>
