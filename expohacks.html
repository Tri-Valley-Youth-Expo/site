  <h1 class="small-boy">Health</h1>
  <p class="content-text">
    Health has always been a field where issues are created just as often as
    they are solved. While epidemics such as the infamous chicken pox and
    measles are almost fully eradicated, cancer, obesity, and other degenerative
    diseases are facing our society today. And that isn’t all — there are plenty
    of physical and mental disabilities that limit other people’s ability to
    succeed. In Health, your goal is to help make the world a safe, inclusive
    place — with a project that makes someone’s life easier, whether it’s a
    modern-day text-to-speak program or an ingenious app for quick medical
    communication.
  </p>
  <h1 class="small-boy">Business</h1>
  <p class="content-text">
    We’re in Silicon Valley, the core of American entrepreneurship — and
    ultra-competitive, at that! Students participating in Expo Hacks will get to
    see a combination of tech and business that will coalesce to show them what
    exactly the Tri-Valley is about; the versatile application of online skills
    to problems that aren’t only faced by ordinary people, but startups and
    corporations as well. Let your passion for tech take you above and beyond —
    accept no limits!
  </p>
  <h1 class="small-boy">Education</h1>
  <p class="content-text">
    School is a staple in most people’s lives for more than a decade — and
    education is an area in tech that can often go overlooked. What do you think
    is a problem your school needs to solve? What issue do you know you can fix?
    Use your skills to create multi-faceted, inventive, accessible solutions.
    And remember, use your imagination — education can encompass an enterprising
    way to raise female education rates in developing countries or address
    poverty in systems all around the world. It’s all about knowledge; use yours
    to help educate the world!
