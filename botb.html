                    <h3 class="banddescription">Grandma's Cat was formed in the
                        spring of 2016 when Reese Posten (Guitar / Lead
                        Vocals) and Alexander Hauer-Molero (Bass / Backing
                        Vocals) met at a middle
                        school swing dance competition (they were playing the
                        music, not dancing. It's
                        better that way). From there they recruited their power
                        center â€” 6' 3" Joe
                        Seaman (Drums). After putting together an initial set of
                        mostly covers from the
                        likes of Green Day, The Foo Fighters, Weezer and the
                        Black Keys they began their
                        journey of performing as a band. Playing the stages of
                        local art and wine
                        festivals, farmers markets and anywhere else there was a
                        mic and a stage. At the
                        same time Reese started bringing original music and
                        lyrics to rehearsals, and as
                        time went on those originals started showing up in their
                        sets. While playing the
                        Half Moon Bay Pumpkin festival, they made friends with
                        the band Get Out, who
                        introduced them to a local promoter, who then booked
                        them for an artist showcase
                        at the fabled DNA Lounge in San Francisco. This show was
                        their first show where
                        the set was made up of mostly original music, from that
                        point on the cover band
                        went away and Grandma's Cat has continue to grow their
                        catalog of original music
                        and fan base. They've gone on to play venues like Brick
                        and Mortar, St. James
                        Gate, Backyard Coffee, Indie Band Music fest and others.
