                    <h3 class="banddescription">The Chefs band formed in the
                        beginning of 2017 and holds 6 members, all from
                        Dublin High
                        School. Members of the band consist of lead singers
                        Matthew Elises and Rohan
                        Fonseka, along
                        with their lead guitarist Jeetu Sujith, bass player
                        Darren Cho, keyboard player
                        Daniel Chai, and
                        drummer Daniel Chen. Combining their last names they
                        form “chchchef” and later,
                        officially
                        became The Chefs. Performing covers of different popular
                        songs, they quickly
                        gained popularity
                        among their peers. From Bruno Mars to Panic At the
                        Disco, The Chefs cover a
                        variety of
                        different artists while putting their own rock twist on
                        these originals. Their
                        love of performing
                        shines through with their high energy shows at
                        birthdays, charity events, and
                        showcases. They
                        hope to continue sharing their love of music and are
                        excited to be competing
                        again in this year’s
                        Battle of the Bands!

                    <h3 class="banddescription">The Side Project began in 2014
                        as a high school trio that wanted to jam after
                        school and write punk rock music. They have gathered
                        some attention playing at
                        high schools, benefit shows, and house shows around the
                        East Bay and are
                        currently working on new material. Last year, they've
                        recruited drummer Daniel
                        Hospitalier and bass player Tallon Avery both from the
                        Castro Valley band,
                        Vivifyd. They are inspired by bands like Green Day,
                        Arctic Monkeys, and The
                        Beatles. If you’re a fan of punk, indie, bedroom-pop,
                        sad energetic music, and
                        internet memes, you’ve found the right band. Their music
                        talks about lives
                        growing up in East Bay California, dealing with
                        relationships, loneliness,
                        boredom, and 80’s movies. They look forward to reaching
                        out to new listeners and
                        to craft their own sound. They are also open to new band
                        names so DM them on
                        Instagram!

                    <h2 class="bandname">Resky</h2>
                    <h3 class="banddescription">Resky is a young indie/rock band
                        from East Bay California. The band was
                        originally formed between singer/guitarist Angel Starr
                        and guitarist David Cook
                        in a high school guitar class. After many lineup
                        changes, David was replaced
                        with guitarist Mat Gracias (which they have met through
                        the band “The Cause”)
                        along with the addition of high school friends: Kyle
                        Libatique on drums and
                        Logan Littlefield on bass. With their influences based
                        around grunge, punk,
                        progressive and psychedelic rock, Resky forms a brick
                        wall of distortion
                        decorated by dynamics and soft guitar melodies.

                        Their songs about their views on life, society, and
                        state of mind test the ways
                        we are raised to view the world. Continuing to play
                        shows in the Berkeley and
                        San Francisco area, they plan to release many singles
                        before releasing their
                        first EP in late 2019.
